Main functions
==============
This application provides you with convenient way of creating new waypoints with any arbitrary coordinates or with coordinates of your current location. The coordinates could be given in different formats: degrees, degrees/minutes, degrees/minutes/seconds. The waypoints are stored in the application persistent storage and they are exported into Saved Locations list of your Garmin watch, so they could be used in other applications. Any point can be edited or deleted.
